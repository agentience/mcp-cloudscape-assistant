## Decision: Create Memory Bank for Project Context

* Create Memory Bank for project context maintenance
* Follow ts-pkg-distro://resource/orchestrator guide for TypeScript package distribution setup
* Use Orchestrator mode to coordinate the implementation of TypeScript package distribution
* Leverage existing package.json and tsconfig.json configurations as they already follow many best practices

## Rationale

* Memory Bank provides persistent context across sessions and modes
* The ts-pkg-distro resource provides specialized guidance for TypeScript package distribution
* Orchestrator mode is best suited for coordinating complex tasks across specialized modes
* The project already has a solid foundation for npm package distribution with proper main, types, and bin fields

## Implementation Details

* Created core Memory Bank files (productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md, systemPatterns.md)
* Will access ts-pkg-distro://resource/orchestrator for detailed guidance
* Will delegate specific implementation tasks to appropriate specialized modes
* Will focus on verifying and enhancing the existing configuration rather than creating from scratch
* Will ensure proper build process, testing, and publishing preparation

## Decision: Rename Package and Expand Scope

* Rename package from `@agentience/mcp-cloudscape-assistant` to `@agentience/react-design-systems-mcp`
* Expand scope to support multiple React design systems beyond AWS Cloudscape
* Update all documentation and configuration to reflect the new name and expanded scope

## Rationale

* The original name was too limiting, focusing only on AWS Cloudscape
* The architecture is capable of supporting multiple React design systems
* Expanding the scope increases the utility and potential user base of the package
* A more generic name better reflects the long-term vision for the project

## Implementation Details

* Updated package name in package.json
* Updated package description to reflect broader scope
* Updated binary name in package.json
* Added additional keywords for other design systems
* Updated repository, bugs, and homepage URLs
* Updated README.md with new package name and expanded scope
* Added roadmap section for future design system support
* Updated installation instructions and usage examples
* Created migration guide for users of the previous package
