# Workflow State

This file tracks the decomposition, delegation, and status of tasks for the current user request.

## Current Request

**ID:** REQ-001
**Date:** 2025-05-05
**Request:** User wants to deploy the `react-design-systems-mcp` server as a Docker container accessed via Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocol for continuous operation and multi-client support.

## Task Breakdown & Status

| | Task ID | Delegated Mode | Status | Dependencies | Description | Deliverables | Start Time | End Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | STRAT-001 | Strategist | Completed | REQ-001 | Gather detailed requirements for implementing SSE and Docker containerization | Updated task-context-REQ-001.md | 2025-05-05 | 2025-05-16 | Requirements successfully gathered |
| | IMPL-001 | Maestro | Completed | STRAT-001 | Implement Docker containerization for the React Design Systems MCP server with SSE support | Dockerfile, .dockerignore, docker-compose.yml, DOCKER.md | 2025-05-16 | 2025-05-16 | Docker implementation completed with documentation |
| | REL-001 | GitMaster | In Progress | IMPL-001 | Create GitHub release to trigger automated workflows | GitHub release from main branch | 2025-05-17 | - | Creating release to trigger Docker image and NPM package publication |

## Key Decisions

* **SSE Implementation:** Use existing FastMCP framework's SSE support via similar invocation to `npm run dev:sse`
* **Docker Configuration:** Expose port 3005 in the container and map to host port 3005
* **Testing Approach:** Manual testing with a client connecting to the SSE endpoint is sufficient
* **No Authentication Required:** The SSE endpoint will not require authentication
* **No Volume Mounts Required:** The server doesn't write files during normal operation
