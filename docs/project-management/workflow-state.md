## Key Decisions

* **SSE Implementation:** Use existing FastMCP framework's SSE support via similar invocation to `npm run dev:sse`
* **Docker Configuration:** Expose port 3005 in the container and map to host port 3005
* **Testing Approach:** Manual testing with a client connecting to the SSE endpoint is sufficient
* **No Authentication Required:** The SSE endpoint will not require authentication
* **No Volume Mounts Required:** The server doesn't write files during normal operation
