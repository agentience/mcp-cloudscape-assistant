# Task Context: REQ-001 - Dockerize MCP Server with SSE

**Request ID:** REQ-001
**Date:** 2025-05-05
**Initial Request:** User wants to deploy the `mcp-cloudscape-assistant` server as a Docker container accessed via Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocol for continuous operation and multi-client support.

**Project:** `mcp-cloudscape-assistant` (Existing project)
**Current State:** The server currently runs via stdio (`server.ts`).

**Goal:** Modify the server to support SSE communication and create a Dockerfile for containerization and deployment.

**Gathered Requirements:**

1.  **SSE Implementation Details:**
    *   **Library/Implementation:** The server already supports SSE through the FastMCP framework via `npm run dev:sse` script
    *   **SSE Endpoint Path:** Use the default path provided by FastMCP
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** No authentication required for the SSE endpoint
    *   **Event Types/Message Formats:** Standard formats provided by FastMCP are sufficient
    *   **Error Handling:** Default error handling provided by FastMCP is sufficient

2.  **Docker Configuration:**
    *   **Base Docker Image:** No specific preference (implementer can choose appropriate image)
    *   **Environment Variables:** No specific environment variables needed
    *   **Port Mapping:** Expose port 3005 in the container and map it to port 3005 on the host
    *   **Volume Mounts:** No volume mounts required (server doesn't write files during normal operation)
    *   **Build Arguments:** No specific build arguments needed

3.  **Deployment Environment:**
    *   **Target Platform:** Local Docker Desktop
    *   **Environment Constraints:** No specific constraints

4.  **Existing Codebase Considerations:**
    *   The server already supports SSE through the FastMCP framework
    *   The Docker container should use a similar invocation to `npm run dev:sse` (which sets `PORT=3005 TRANSPORT_TYPE=sse`)
    *   No specific code migration needed as SSE support already exists

5.  **Testing:**
    *   Manual testing with a client connecting to the SSE endpoint within the container is sufficient

**Relevant Files:**
*   `server-fastmcp.ts` (Current implementation with SSE support)
*   `package.json` (Contains the `dev:sse` script)
*   `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript config)
*   `/docs/project-management/workflow-state.md` (Overall tracking)
