# Task Context: REL-001 - Create GitHub Release

## Task Definition
Create a GitHub release from the main branch to trigger the automated workflows for Docker image and NPM package publication.

## Background
The project has successfully implemented Docker containerization for the React Design Systems MCP server with SSE support. The GitHub workflows are configured to trigger on GitHub release creation. We need to create a release to initiate these automated processes.

## Current State
- Docker implementation is complete (IMPL-001)
- GitHub workflows are configured to trigger on release creation
- Current package version: 1.0.4
- Pre-publication checklist is complete

## Requirements
1. Create a GitHub release from the main branch
2. Use tag v1.0.4 to match the current package version
3. Include appropriate release notes
4. Ensure the release triggers both workflows:
   - docker-publish.yml (for Docker image)
   - publish.yml (for NPM package)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub release is created with tag v1.0.4
- [ ] Release notes include summary of changes
- [ ] Docker image workflow is triggered and completes successfully
- [ ] NPM package workflow is triggered and completes successfully

## Dependencies
- IMPL-001: Docker implementation (Completed)

## Resources
- [npm Publication Guide](../npm-publication-guide.md)
- [Pre-Publication Checklist](../pre-publication-checklist.md)
- [GitHub Workflow: docker-publish.yml](../../.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml)
- [GitHub Workflow: publish.yml](../../.github/workflows/publish.yml)

## Notes
- This is the first release using the automated GitHub workflows
- Both workflows are configured to trigger on the "created" release event type
- The Docker image will be published to GitHub Container Registry
- The NPM package will be published to the npm registry
