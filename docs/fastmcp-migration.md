# FastMCP Migration

This document outlines the migration from the custom MCP server implementation to the FastMCP framework.

## Overview

The MCP Cloudscape Assistant has been migrated from a custom implementation to use the FastMCP framework, which provides a more structured and type-safe approach to building MCP servers. FastMCP offers several advantages over the custom implementation:

- Simplified tool and resource definition
- Built-in support for authentication
- Session management
- Image and audio content handling
- Improved logging
- Better error handling
- Support for SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- CORS support
- Progress notifications
- Typed server events
- Prompt argument auto-completion

## Migration Steps

The migration was completed in the following steps:

1. Implemented all tools and resources in the FastMCP server (`src/mcp/fastmcp-server.ts`)
2. Created a new entry point (`server-fastmcp.ts`) that uses the FastMCP implementation
3. Updated package.json to make the FastMCP implementation the main entry point
4. Updated dependent files to use the FastMCP implementation
5. Ran comprehensive tests to ensure all functionality works as expected
6. Removed the old implementation (`src/mcp/server.ts`) and related files

## Changes Made

### Package.json

- Updated `main` to point to `dist/server-fastmcp.js`
- Updated `bin` to point to `dist/server-fastmcp.js`
- Updated scripts to use the FastMCP implementation
- Added a script to run the legacy implementation for backward compatibility

### Integration and Security Modules

- Updated `src/integration/roo-integration.ts` to work with FastMCP
- Updated `src/security/index.ts` to work with FastMCP

### Entry Point

- Created a new entry point (`server-fastmcp.ts`) that uses the FastMCP implementation
- Applied security enhancements and Roo integration to the FastMCP server

## Running the Server

### Transport Types

The FastMCP server supports two transport types:

1. **stdio (default)**: Standard input/output transport for local server communication
2. **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: HTTP-based transport for web applications and remote clients

### Running with stdio Transport (Default)

To run the FastMCP server with the default stdio transport:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running with SSE Transport

To run the FastMCP server with SSE transport:

```bash
npm run dev:sse
```

## Testing

All tests have been updated to work with the FastMCP implementation. To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Backward Compatibility

For backward compatibility, the old implementation can still be run using:

```bash
npm run dev:legacy
```

However, this is only provided for transition purposes and will be removed in a future release.
