# Branch Cleanup Report

## Task Summary
- **Task ID:** GIT-002
- **Date:** 2025-05-17
- **Objective:** Clean up branches and ensure proper synchronization between develop and main branches, both locally and remotely.

## Actions Performed

### 1. Branch Cleanup
- Removed local feature branches that have been merged:
  - `feature/CA-2-nodejs-upgrade` (was 2bb75b6)
  - `feature/CA-2-documentation-updates` (was 1b0d60c)
- Verified remote feature branches were already deleted (likely automatically after PR merges)
- Pruned stale remote references with `git fetch --prune`

### 2. Branch Synchronization
- Synchronized local main branch with origin/main:
  - Pulled changes from PR #1 (Node.js 24.0.1 upgrade)
- Merged main into develop to ensure both branches are in sync:
  - Resolved merge conflicts in `docs/project-management/workflow-state.md`
  - Preserved task entries UPG-009 and UPG-010 from develop branch
- Pushed synchronized develop branch to origin

## Current Repository State
- **Active Branches:**
  - `develop` (local and remote)
  - `main` (local and remote)
- **Removed Branches:**
  - `feature/CA-2-nodejs-upgrade` (local and remote)
  - `feature/CA-2-documentation-updates` (local and remote)

## Issues Encountered and Resolution
- **Merge Conflict:** Encountered merge conflicts in `docs/project-management/workflow-state.md` when merging main into develop.
  - **Resolution:** Manually resolved conflicts by preserving the task entries from the develop branch while incorporating changes from main.

## Verification
- Confirmed that develop branch contains all changes from main
- Confirmed that local branches are synchronized with their remote counterparts
- Confirmed that merged feature branches have been removed both locally and remotely
- Confirmed that the repository is in a clean state with only the necessary branches

## Recommendations
- Continue using the GitFlow branching strategy with feature branches for new features
- Regularly clean up merged feature branches to keep the repository tidy
- Consider setting up automatic branch deletion after PR merges if not already configured
- Periodically synchronize develop and main branches to prevent large merge conflicts
