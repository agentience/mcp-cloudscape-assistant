# Release v1.0.4 Summary

## Completed Actions
- Created and pushed tag v1.0.4 to match the current package version
- Created GitHub release with comprehensive release notes
- Successfully triggered both automated workflows:
  - Docker image workflow completed successfully
  - NPM package workflow failed due to version conflict (version 1.0.4 already exists in npm registry)

## Results
- GitHub Release: Successfully created at https://github.com/agentience/react-design-systems-mcp/releases/tag/v1.0.4
- Docker Image: Successfully published to GitHub Container Registry
- NPM Package: Publication failed because version 1.0.4 already exists in the npm registry

## Next Steps
To complete the NPM package publication, the following steps are required:

1. Update the package version in package.json to a new version (e.g., 1.0.5)
2. Commit and push the version change
3. Create a new tag and GitHub release with the new version
4. Verify that both workflows complete successfully

## Git Commands for Next Release
```bash
# Update version in package.json (can be done manually or with npm version)
npm version patch  # This will update to 1.0.5

# Commit and push changes
git push origin main

# Create and push tag
git tag -a v1.0.5 -m "Release v1.0.5"
git push origin v1.0.5

# Create GitHub release
gh release create v1.0.5 --title "Release v1.0.5" --notes-file release-notes.md
```

## Workflow Verification
The GitHub workflows are correctly configured to trigger on release creation. The Docker image workflow is working as expected. The NPM package workflow is also correctly configured but requires a unique version number for each publication.

## Conclusion
This first release using the automated GitHub workflows was partially successful. The Docker image was published successfully, but the NPM package publication requires a version update. This is a normal part of the release process and will be addressed in the next release.
