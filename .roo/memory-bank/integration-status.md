## MCP Tools

The Cloudscape MCP Server will provide the following tools to Roo:

1. **search_components**: Search for Cloudscape components
   ```typescript
   interface SearchComponentsInput {
     query: string;
     category?: string;
     tags?: string[];
     limit?: number;
   }
   ```

2. **get_component_details**: Get detailed information about a component
   ```typescript
   interface GetComponentDetailsInput {
     componentId: string;
   }
   ```

3. **generate_component_code**: Generate code for a component
   ```typescript
   interface GenerateComponentCodeInput {
     componentId: string;
     props?: Record<string, any>;
     children?: string;
     eventHandlers?: Record<string, string>;
   }
   ```

4. **generate_pattern_code**: Generate code for a common pattern
   ```typescript
   interface GeneratePatternCodeInput {
     patternId: string;
     customizations?: Record<string, any>;
   }
   ```

5. **get_component_examples**: Get usage examples for a component
   ```typescript
   interface GetComponentExamplesInput {
     componentId: string;
     type?: string;
     limit?: number;
   }
   ```

## MCP Resources

The Cloudscape MCP Server will provide the following resources to Roo:

1. **cloudscape://components/{componentId}**: Get component details
2. **cloudscape://categories/{categoryId}**: Get category details
3. **cloudscape://patterns/{patternId}**: Get pattern details
4. **cloudscape://examples/{exampleId}**: Get example details
5. **cloudscape://properties/{componentId}/{propertyId}**: Get property details

## Frontend-Code Mode Configuration

The frontend-code mode will be configured in the `.roomodes.yaml` file with the following settings:

```yaml
frontend-code:
  name: "Frontend Code"
  description: "Specialized mode for UI development with Cloudscape components"
  extends: "code"
  model: "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"
  rules:
    - ".roo/rules-code/*.roo.md"
    - ".roo/rules-frontend-code/*.roo.md"
  mcp_servers:
    - "cloudscape"
```

## Next Steps

1. Monitor usage and gather feedback
2. Consider expanding tool and resource offerings based on user needs
3. Explore integration with additional AWS services
4. Plan for future enhancements based on user feedback
5. Maintain and update documentation as needed
