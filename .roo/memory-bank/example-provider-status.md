## Example Structure

The Example Provider will use the following structure for examples:

```typescript
interface ExampleMetadata {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  component: string;
  code: string;
  type: string;
  tags: string[];
  dependencies: string[];
}

interface ExampleOptions {
  componentId: string;
  type?: string;
  limit?: number;
  offset?: number;
  tags?: string[];
}

interface ExampleResponse {
  examples: ExampleMetadata[];
  totalExamples: number;
  componentId: string;
  type?: string;
  limit?: number;
  offset?: number;
}

function getExamples(options: ExampleOptions): ExampleResponse;
```

## Example Types

The Example Provider will support the following example types:

1. **Basic**: Basic usage of the component
2. **Advanced**: Advanced usage of the component
3. **WithProps**: Examples with different props
4. **WithChildren**: Examples with children
5. **WithEventHandlers**: Examples with event handlers
6. **InContext**: Examples in different contexts
7. **WithTheme**: Examples with different themes
8. **Responsive**: Examples demonstrating responsive behavior
9. **Accessibility**: Examples with accessibility considerations
10. **Combinations**: Examples of component combinations

## Example Tags

The Example Provider will support tagging examples for improved searchability. Common tags will include:

1. **Beginner**: Examples suitable for beginners
2. **Intermediate**: Examples suitable for intermediate users
3. **Advanced**: Examples suitable for advanced users
4. **BestPractice**: Examples demonstrating best practices
5. **AntiPattern**: Examples demonstrating anti-patterns
6. **Performance**: Examples demonstrating performance considerations
7. **Accessibility**: Examples demonstrating accessibility considerations
8. **Responsive**: Examples demonstrating responsive behavior
9. **Mobile**: Examples optimized for mobile devices
10. **Desktop**: Examples optimized for desktop devices

## Example Dependencies

The Example Provider will track dependencies for examples, including:

1. **Component Dependencies**: Other components used in the example
2. **External Dependencies**: External libraries or resources used in the example
3. **CSS Dependencies**: CSS styles required for the example
4. **Data Dependencies**: Data required for the example

## Next Steps

1. Expand examples with more complex scenarios
2. Optimize example retrieval performance
3. Enhance example search functionality
4. Add more interactive examples
5. Integrate with Phase 4 testing framework

## Issues and Challenges

1. Maintaining a comprehensive set of examples requires significant effort
2. Ensuring examples are up-to-date with the latest component versions
3. Balancing between simple examples and complex real-world scenarios
4. Optimizing performance for large example collections

## Dependencies

- Component Registry implementation
- MCP server framework implementation

## Notes

- The Example Provider will be tightly integrated with the Component Registry
- Consider implementing a caching mechanism for frequently accessed examples
- The example structure may evolve as implementation progresses
- Consider implementing a preview mechanism for examples
- Consider implementing a live editor for examples
- Examples should be well-documented and follow best practices
- Examples should be tested to ensure they work correctly
