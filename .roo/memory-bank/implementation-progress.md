## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Incomplete component metadata | Medium | High | Establish a systematic process for collecting and validating component metadata |
| Performance issues with large component library | Medium | Medium | Implement efficient data structures and consider caching strategies |
| Integration challenges with Roo | Medium | High | Early prototyping of integration points and regular communication with Roo team |
| Complexity in code generation | High | Medium | Start with simple templates and incrementally add complexity |
| Resource constraints | Low | Medium | Prioritize features based on user needs and implement incrementally |
