## Code Generation Interfaces

The Code Generator will expose the following interfaces:

```typescript
interface CodeGenerationOptions {
  componentId: string;
  props?: Record<string, any>;
  children?: string;
  eventHandlers?: Record<string, string>;
  typescript?: boolean;
  style?: 'compact' | 'expanded';
  includeImports?: boolean;
}

interface PatternGenerationOptions {
  patternId: string;
  customizations?: Record<string, any>;
  typescript?: boolean;
  style?: 'compact' | 'expanded';
  includeImports?: boolean;
}

interface GeneratedCode {
  code: string;
  imports: string[];
  language: 'javascript' | 'typescript';
  format: 'jsx' | 'tsx';
}

function generateComponentCode(options: CodeGenerationOptions): GeneratedCode;
function generatePatternCode(options: PatternGenerationOptions): GeneratedCode;
```

## Supported Component Patterns

The Code Generator will support the following component patterns:

1. **Basic Component Usage**: Generate code for basic component usage
2. **Component with Props**: Generate code for components with various props
3. **Component with Children**: Generate code for components with children
4. **Component with Event Handlers**: Generate code for components with event handlers
5. **Component Combinations**: Generate code for common component combinations

## Supported Cloudscape Patterns

The Code Generator will support the following Cloudscape patterns:

1. **Data Tables**: Tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination
2. **Form Layouts**: Forms with validation and error handling
3. **Application Layouts**: Standard application layouts with navigation, content, and tools panels
4. **Card Layouts**: Card-based layouts for displaying collections of items
5. **Dashboard Layouts**: Dashboard layouts with multiple widgets and visualizations
6. **Wizard Flows**: Step-by-step wizard flows for complex processes
7. **Split Panels**: Split panel layouts for side-by-side content
8. **Detail Pages**: Detail pages with header, content, and actions
9. **List Pages**: List pages with filtering, sorting, and pagination
10. **Navigation Patterns**: Navigation patterns with breadcrumbs, tabs, and side navigation

## Template System

The Code Generator will use a template-based system for code generation. Templates will be defined for each component and pattern, with placeholders for customizable elements.

Example template for a Button component:

```
import Button from "@cloudscape-design/components/button";

<Button
  variant="{{variant}}"
  {{#if disabled}}disabled{{/if}}
  {{#if loading}}loading{{/if}}
  {{#if onClick}}onClick={{{onClick}}}{{/if}}
>
  {{children}}
</Button>
```

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with Phase 4 testing framework
2. Optimize performance for large code generation requests
3. Add more pattern templates
4. Enhance TypeScript interface generation
5. Improve error handling and validation

## Issues and Challenges

1. Handling complex component props that require special formatting
2. Ensuring generated code follows best practices and is maintainable
3. Optimizing performance for large code generation requests
4. Maintaining consistency between different code styles and formats

## Dependencies

- Component Registry implementation (Completed)
- MCP server framework implementation (Completed)

## Notes

- The Code Generator uses a template-based approach as planned
- The current implementation uses string templates directly in the code
- In Phase 2, consider moving templates to separate files for better maintenance
- The code generation system is extensible and can support new components and patterns
- A preview mechanism for generated code should be considered for Phase 3
