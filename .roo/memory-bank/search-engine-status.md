## Search Engine Interface

The Search Engine will expose the following interface:

```typescript
interface SearchOptions {
  query: string;
  category?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  limit?: number;
  offset?: number;
  sortBy?: string;
  sortOrder?: 'asc' | 'desc';
  filters?: Record<string, any>;
}

interface SearchResult {
  componentId: string;
  name: string;
  category: string;
  description: string;
  relevance: number;
  matchedFields: string[];
}

interface SearchResponse {
  results: SearchResult[];
  totalResults: number;
  query: string;
  category?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  limit?: number;
  offset?: number;
}

function searchComponents(options: SearchOptions): SearchResponse;
```

## Search Algorithm

The search algorithm has been implemented as follows:

1. **Exact Match**: First, look for components that exactly match the search term in their name, description, or tags.
2. **Fuzzy Match**: If exact matches are insufficient, use fuzzy matching with Levenshtein distance algorithm to find components that approximately match the search term.
3. **Category Filter**: If a category is specified, filter results to include only components in that category.
4. **Tag Filter**: If tags are specified, filter results to include only components with those tags.
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Apply additional filters such as experimental status, version, and property existence.
6. **Ranking**: Rank results based on relevance, with exact matches ranked higher than fuzzy matches, and different weights for matches in different fields.
7. **Pagination**: Apply limit and offset for pagination.
8. **Sorting**: Apply sorting by different fields (name, relevance, category).

## Performance Considerations

- Implement indexing for efficient search
- Consider caching frequently searched terms
- Optimize ranking algorithm for performance
- Use efficient data structures for search operations

## Next Steps

1. Implement more advanced search features
2. Optimize search performance for larger component sets
3. Implement search analytics to track popular search terms
4. Add more sophisticated relevance ranking algorithms
5. Enhance search result presentation

## Issues and Challenges

1. Balancing search accuracy with performance as the component set grows
2. Fine-tuning relevance ranking for different use cases
3. Handling complex filtering requirements while maintaining a clean API
4. Optimizing fuzzy matching for performance

## Dependencies

- Component Registry implementation (Completed)
- MCP server framework implementation (Completed)

## Notes

- The Search Engine is tightly integrated with the Component Registry as planned
- A search index should be implemented in Phase 2 for improved performance
- The current search algorithm works well for basic searches but will need enhancement for fuzzy matching
- Search analytics should be considered for Phase 3 or 4 to track popular search terms
