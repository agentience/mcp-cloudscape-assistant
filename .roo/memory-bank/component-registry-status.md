# Component Registry Status

This document tracks the status of the Component Registry implementation for the Cloudscape MCP Server.

## Overview

The Component Registry is the core of the Cloudscape MCP Server. It stores metadata and documentation for all Cloudscape components, including their properties, examples, and relationships.

## Current Status

**Implementation Status**: Completed (Phase 2)
**Progress**: 100% (Phase 2), 60% (Overall)
**Priority**: High
**Assigned To**: Cloudscape MCP Team

## Key Features

| Feature | Status | Progress | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| Component Metadata Storage | Completed | 100% | Implemented in registry.js with data files |
| Component Relationships | Completed | 100% | Implemented with relatedComponents property |
| Component Versioning | Completed | 100% | Implemented with version property |
| Component Categories | Completed | 100% | Implemented with categories.js data file |
| Component Tags | Completed | 100% | Implemented with tags property for searchability |

- [x] Component relationship tracking
- [x] Component versioning
- [x] Component categorization
- [x] Component tagging
- [x] Tests for enhanced functionality

## Component Metadata Structure

The Component Registry will use the following metadata structure:

```typescript
interface ComponentRegistry {
  components: Record<string, ComponentMetadata>;
  categories: Record<string, CategoryMetadata>;
  patterns: Record<string, PatternMetadata>;
  examples: Record<string, ExampleMetadata>;
}

interface ComponentMetadata {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: string;
  description: string;
  importPath: string;
  version: string;
  isExperimental: boolean;
  relatedComponents: string[];
  tags: string[];
  properties: Record<string, PropertyMetadata>;
  examples: string[];
}

interface CategoryMetadata {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  components: string[];
}

interface PatternMetadata {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  components: string[];
  code: string;
  customizationOptions: Record<string, CustomizationOption>;
}

interface ExampleMetadata {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  component: string;
  code: string;
  type: string;
}

interface PropertyMetadata {
  name: string;
  type: string;
  description: string;
  defaultValue: any;
  required: boolean;
  acceptedValues: string[];
  isDeprecated: boolean;
  examples: string[];
}

interface CustomizationOption {
  name: string;
  type: string;
  description: string;
  defaultValue: any;
  acceptedValues: string[];
}
```

## Component Coverage

| Category | Total Components | Components with Metadata | Progress |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| Foundation | 6 | 4 | 67% |
| Navigation | 6 | 4 | 67% |
| Input | 14 | 6 | 43% |
| Display | 12 | 5 | 42% |
| Charts | 7 | 0 | 0% |
| Specialized | 6 | 1 | 17% |
| **Total** | **51+** | **20** | **39%** |

## Next Steps

1. Continue expanding the Component Registry with metadata for more Cloudscape components
2. Further enhance component relationship tracking
3. Add more detailed versioning information
4. Refine component categorization
5. Expand component tagging for better searchability
6. Add more comprehensive tests

## Issues and Challenges

1. Collecting accurate metadata for all components requires significant effort
2. Ensuring consistency in component metadata across different categories
3. Balancing the level of detail in component metadata with maintainability
4. Managing the growing complexity of component relationships

## Dependencies

- MCP server framework implementation (Completed)
- Component metadata collection and validation (Ongoing)

## Notes

- The Component Registry has been implemented as a set of JavaScript modules
- The metadata structure is working well and has been refined in Phase 2
- A validation mechanism for component metadata has been implemented
- A mechanism to merge base components with additional components has been implemented
- A structure for adding more components in the future has been created
- A caching mechanism for frequently accessed components should be considered for performance optimization
