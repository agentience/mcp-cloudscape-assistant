# Property Explorer Status

This document tracks the status of the Property Explorer implementation for the Cloudscape MCP Server.

## Overview

The Property Explorer allows exploration of component properties and their usage. It provides detailed information about component properties, including descriptions, types, default values, and usage examples.

## Property Information Structure

The Property Explorer will use the following structure for property information:

```typescript
interface PropertyMetadata {
  name: string;
  type: string;
  description: string;
  defaultValue: any;
  required: boolean;
  acceptedValues: string[];
  isDeprecated: boolean;
  examples: string[];
  relatedProperties: string[];
}

interface PropertyExplorerOptions {
  componentId: string;
  propertyId?: string;
  filter?: Record<string, any>;
}

function getProperties(options: PropertyExplorerOptions): Record<string, PropertyMetadata> | PropertyMetadata;
```

## Property Types

The Property Explorer will support the following property types:

1. **String**: Text values
2. **Number**: Numeric values
3. **Boolean**: True/false values
4. **Object**: Complex objects
5. **Array**: Arrays of values
6. **Function**: Function references
7. **ReactNode**: React node references
8. **Enum**: Enumerated values
9. **Union**: Union of multiple types
10. **Custom**: Custom types defined by Cloudscape

## Property Relationships

The Property Explorer will track the following property relationships:

1. **Dependent Properties**: Properties that depend on other properties
2. **Mutually Exclusive Properties**: Properties that cannot be used together
3. **Required Combinations**: Properties that must be used together
4. **Conditional Properties**: Properties that are only valid under certain conditions

## Property Usage Examples

The Property Explorer will provide the following types of property usage examples:

1. **Basic Usage**: Basic usage of the property
2. **Advanced Usage**: Advanced usage of the property
3. **Combinations**: Usage of the property in combination with other properties
4. **Edge Cases**: Usage of the property in edge cases

## Next Steps

1. Expand property information for more Cloudscape components
2. Enhance property relationship detection
3. Add more property examples
4. Implement more advanced property filtering
5. Optimize property retrieval performance

## Issues and Challenges

1. Collecting accurate property information for all components requires significant effort
2. Detecting property relationships automatically is complex
3. Balancing the level of detail in property information with maintainability
4. Handling complex property types and their documentation

## Dependencies

- Component Registry implementation
- MCP server framework implementation

## Notes

- The Property Explorer has been implemented and is tightly integrated with the Component Registry
- Property filtering capabilities have been implemented for required status, deprecated status, type, and name pattern
- Property relationship detection has been implemented for dependent properties, mutually exclusive properties, required combinations, and conditional properties
- Property type information retrieval has been implemented
- Property examples support has been added
- A caching mechanism for frequently accessed property information should be considered for performance optimization
- A visualization mechanism for property relationships should be considered for future enhancements
