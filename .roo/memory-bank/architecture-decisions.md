# Cloudscape MCP Server Architecture Decisions

This document records key architectural decisions made during the development of the Cloudscape MCP Server.

## ADR-001: Modular Architecture

**Decision**: Implement the Cloudscape MCP Server using a modular architecture with six key components: Component Registry, Search Engine, Code Generator, Documentation Provider, Property Explorer, and Example Provider.

**Context**: The server needs to provide multiple capabilities including component search, code generation, documentation access, and property exploration. A modular architecture allows for separation of concerns and easier maintenance.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Monolithic architecture
- Microservices architecture

**Rationale**: A modular architecture provides a good balance between separation of concerns and simplicity. It allows for independent development and testing of each component while maintaining a cohesive system.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Easier maintenance and testing
- Positive: Clear separation of concerns
- Positive: Ability to evolve components independently
- Negative: Potential overhead in component communication

**Status**: Approved

## ADR-002: JSON-based Component Registry

**Decision**: Implement the Component Registry as a JSON database.

**Context**: The Component Registry needs to store metadata and documentation for all Cloudscape components. The data structure is relatively stable and does not require complex querying capabilities.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Relational database
- NoSQL database
- In-memory data structure

**Rationale**: A JSON database provides a simple and flexible solution for storing component metadata. It allows for easy serialization and deserialization, and does not require a separate database server.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Simplicity in implementation
- Positive: Easy serialization and deserialization
- Positive: No need for a separate database server
- Negative: Limited querying capabilities
- Negative: Potential performance issues with large datasets

**Status**: Approved

## ADR-003: Template-based Code Generation

**Decision**: Implement the Code Generator using a template-based approach.

**Context**: The Code Generator needs to generate code snippets for common Cloudscape patterns. The generated code should be customizable and follow best practices.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- AST-based code generation
- String concatenation

**Rationale**: A template-based approach provides a good balance between flexibility and simplicity. It allows for easy customization of generated code while maintaining readability.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Easy customization of generated code
- Positive: Readable templates
- Positive: Separation of code structure and content
- Negative: Limited ability to generate complex code structures
- Negative: Potential maintenance overhead for templates

**Status**: Approved

## ADR-004: MCP Integration Approach

**Decision**: Integrate with Roo through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by exposing tools and resources.

**Context**: The server needs to integrate with Roo to provide specialized capabilities for UI development with Cloudscape components. The MCP provides a standardized way for Roo to communicate with external servers.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom integration protocol
- REST API

**Rationale**: The MCP provides a standardized way for Roo to communicate with external servers. It allows for easy integration and provides a consistent user experience.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Standardized integration with Roo
- Positive: Consistent user experience
- Positive: Ability to leverage existing MCP infrastructure
- Negative: Dependency on MCP protocol evolution

**Status**: Approved

## ADR-005: Component Metadata Structure

**Decision**: Define a comprehensive metadata structure for Cloudscape components that includes properties, examples, and related components.

**Context**: The Component Registry needs to store detailed information about each component to support various use cases such as search, code generation, and documentation.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Minimal metadata with links to external documentation
- Separate storage for different types of component information

**Rationale**: A comprehensive metadata structure provides a single source of truth for component information. It allows for efficient retrieval and processing of component data.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Single source of truth for component information
- Positive: Efficient retrieval and processing of component data
- Positive: Comprehensive support for various use cases
- Negative: Increased complexity in metadata management
- Negative: Potential duplication of information

**Status**: Approved

## ADR-006: Search Engine Implementation

**Decision**: Implement the Search Engine using a combination of exact matching, fuzzy matching, and ranking algorithms.

**Context**: The Search Engine needs to provide efficient component search and retrieval functionality. Users should be able to find components by name, category, or functionality.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- External search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch)
- Simple string matching

**Rationale**: A combination of exact matching, fuzzy matching, and ranking algorithms provides a good balance between search quality and implementation complexity. It allows for flexible search capabilities without the overhead of an external search engine.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Flexible search capabilities
- Positive: No dependency on external search engines
- Positive: Customizable ranking algorithms
- Negative: Potential complexity in implementation
- Negative: Limited scalability for very large component libraries

**Status**: Approved

## Future Decisions

The following architectural decisions are planned for future consideration:

1. **Caching Strategy**: Determine the appropriate caching strategy for component metadata and generated code.
2. **Error Handling**: Define a consistent approach to error handling and reporting.
3. **Versioning**: Determine how to handle different versions of Cloudscape components.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and implement performance optimizations for the server.
5. **Security Considerations**: Define security measures for the server.
